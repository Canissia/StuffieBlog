# StuffieBlog

Searchable Website made with Javascript, Bootstrap, Express, Node.js, Typescript. Using MongoDB database.

To practice backend development I made this Stuffie Blog. It was originally a Recipe blog by Raddy. I stylized and added my own spin on it to suit my needs. Thanks to Raddy, Pixabay, and Unsplash.
